<p class="lead">Welcome to my page! My name is Thai Tran. I am currently a freshman attending California State Long Beach. As a kid, I've always been fascinated with technology and how it operates. As I got older, this interest of mine became my motivation to study in the STEM field as I wish to pursue a career in this area. Some of my hobbies include swimming, playing video games, and volleyball. I enjoy to hang out with my friends during my free time and whenever I'm alone, I prefer to watch T.V. shows/movies. I wish to be successful in my career in the future so I can support my parents who've done so much for me throughout my life. I also hope that I'll be able to make a difference in this world through perserverance and determination!</p>
